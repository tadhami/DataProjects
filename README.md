# DataProjects
I worked on these projects as a way to demonstrate what I've learned about data science
and data analytics. There were earlier practice projects that I did before these 
using the following tutorial sites: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-skills-web-scraping-using-python-d1a85ef607ed and 
https://towardsdatascience.com/elegant-way-to-make-data-talk-stories-exploratory-data-analysis-783e68837a2
and I used the information I learned from those to build larger projects where I could apply multiple topics I learned towards something new.
I thought about including those earlier projects too, but figured that it would be a better demonstration of what I'm capable of if 
I built a project where I applied everything I practiced (and applied those things to data that align with some of my hobbies) and included
that instead.
