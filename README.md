# DataProjects
I worked on these projects as a way to demonstrate what I've learned about data science
and data analytics. There were earlier practice projects that I did before these 
using the following tutorial sites: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-skills-web-scraping-using-python-d1a85ef607ed and 
https://towardsdatascience.com/elegant-way-to-make-data-talk-stories-exploratory-data-analysis-783e68837a2
and I used some of the information I learned from those in the process of building larger projects where I could apply multiple topics I learned towards something new.
I thought about including those earlier projects too, but thought that it would be a better demonstration of what I can do if 
I built a project where I applied everything I practiced (and applied those things to data that align with some of my hobbies).

My next goal for these projects is to generate predictive models for them, so that is personally what I want to learn next. 

Project 3: Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis using MyAniList top 100
- Duration: 3 months
- Technologies used: Python3, Jupyter Notebook
  - Programmed a web scraper to generate a dataset of anime from the MyAniList top 100
  - Cleaned up and modified the dataset in preparation for statistical analysis and data visualization
  - Performed statistical analysis and generated plots/visualized data from dataset

Pokemon Project: Exploratory data analysis on the Pokemon Dataset
- Duration: 2 weeks 
- Technologies used: Python3, Jupyter Notebook
  - Read in CSV file to generate a dataset
  - Cleaned up and modified the dataset in preparation for statistical analysis and data visualization
  - Performed statistical analysis and generated plots/visualized data from dataset
